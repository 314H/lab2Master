### Community

The following example (inside the `community` directory) shows how Gephi can infer communities in a simples graph.

The graph is produced starting from the following CSV file: [community.csv](community/community-simple.csv).

Using the `[Modularity]` module in the `statistics` tab, the modules or communities are inferred inside the graph. The comminities are then related to the colors in the `[Appearance]` tab.

The resulting graph can be seen in the illustration below. The resulting Gephi file can be downloaded at: [community.gephi](community/community-simple.gephi).
