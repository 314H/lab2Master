      "The document 3 has the following 'case': ['CASE 4 \\n\\nA married woman, 43 years old, is seen April 9. Family history \\nnegative. Haa had three children, the youngest being twenty years \\nold, and no miscarriages. Eighteen years ago she began to suSer from \\nprofuse menstruation which became so excessive and exhausting that \\neighteen months ago the uterus and appendages were removed. In \\nspite of the cessatloa of the hemorrhages she says that she has lost \\nground and grown paler more rapidly since the operation. For the \\npast six months nose bleeds have been frequent and at times so ex- \\ncessive that the nares have been plugged. She has had \"feverish \\nturns,\" lasting several days at a time, but her chief complaint has \\nbeen of weakness, great dyspnoea, palpitation, and attacks of faint- \\nness. Micturition has been more frequent for the past few years, but \\nwithout any polyuria. Her legs and ankles have been considerably \\nswollen, but this haa been much less apparent lately. About a month \\nago she had a copious epistaxis, followed, four days later, by a second, \\nless severe, and has remained in bed ever since. Her temperature was \\nfirst taken March 28, when it was found to be slightly above normal. \\nWithout discoverable local cause, it rose steadily till it reached 103\" \\nsix days later. It fell to normal two days later, but the evening record \\nhas since been several times as high as 99.4°. With the rise in her \\ntemperature, her color, previously very pale, became lemon-yellow, \\nbut the conjunctive remained a pearly white. She was greatly ex- \\nhausted and somewhat delirious, vomiting occasionally either food or \\nbile-stained mucus. A very grave prognosis was at this time given \\nby the attending physician. \\n\\nWhen seen April 9, patient reported herself as feeling very well, \\nand her mental condition was bright. She was markedly ansemic, \\nbut with only a slight yellow tinge remaining. The tongue and mucous \\nmembranes were very pale. There was a deep ulceration on the left \\nside of the nasal septum and several crusts were seen on the right. A \\nsystolic murmur was heard in the vessels of the neck. The heart\\'s \\napex was in the fifth space in the nipple line. The cardiac dulness \\nextended a finger\\'s breadth and a half to the right of sternum. A \\nsystolic murmur was heard all over the precordia, rough over the base, \\nbut becoming softer as the apex was approached and transmitted a \\nshort distance into the axilla. The pulmonic second was slightly ac- \\ncentuated. The upper border of the liver was at the fifth rib, and its \\nsmooth edge could be felt two fingers\\' breadth below the costal margin. \\nThe edge of the spleen was readily palpated. The ankles were slightly \\ncedematous. The ophthalmoscope showed a normal fundus. Physical \\nexamination was otherwise negative. \\n\\nUrine, sp. gr. 1012, pale, acid, contains the slightest possible trace \\nof albumen. Sediment slight, consisting of leucocytes, and a rare \\nnormal red cell; no casts. A blood count on April 3 showed 300,000 \\nreds, 5400 whites, Hgb. 10%. A differential count of 400 whites showed \\npolymorphonuclear 72%, large mononuclear 12%, small mononuclear \\n15%, eosinophiles 1%. Ten megaloblasts, 5 nonnoblasts, and 3 micro- \\nblasts were seen. Poikilocytosis, macrocytosis, and polychromato- \\nphilia were present. A second count made to-day showed 1,000,000 \\nreds, 5800 whites, Hgb. 25%. A differential count of 300 white cells \\nshowed no special change in the proportions. Four megaloblasts, II \\nnormoblasts, and 2 microblasts were found. \\n\\n1. What 619 the common causes of frequent micturition in women and in men? \\n\\nIn women, (a) nervousness and debility from any cause; (6) less often \\ncystitis (\"simple,\" gonorrhceaJ, tuberculous, or calculous); (c) the pressure of \\nthe pregnant ut«ruH or other tumors; (d) pyelitis (tuberculous or septic). \\nIn men, (a) prostatic obstruction and its results; (b) cystitis (gonDirhoeal, \\ntuberculous, etc.); (c) pyelitis (as in women). Occasionally, in either sex, \\nchronic nephritis may produce frequent as well as profuse micturition. \\n\\n2. What aie the possible causes of a systolic murmur like that here described? \\n\\n(a) Arterio sclerotic rou^ening of the aortic arch or of the aortic valves; \\n(t) Ansmia and other causes of insufficient muscular contraction of the \\nvalve-orificea (but such murmurs are usually louder in the pulmonary area). \\n(c) Aneurism of the aoHia; (d) Aortic stenosis (provided always that other \\nsigns of that lesion are present, thrill and plateau pulse especially). \\n\\n3. How are the \"feverish turns\" to be explained in this case? Fever in chronic \\n\\nanemia, especially pernicious aniemia, is not uncommon. Aft«r any profuse \\nhemorrhage it often occurs in neurotic peisons. \\n\\n4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: The blood is chara^iteristic of pernicious ansmia. The hemorrhages \\nare probably symptoms, not causes, of the anemia, for such a blood picture \\nrarely if ever results from hemorrhage of the type here described. The \\nrespiratory, cardiac, and digestive symptoms, as well as the ledema, weakness, \\nand fever, can be explained by the anemia. Other diseases are excluded by \\nthe absence of phjrsical signs pointing to them. \\n\\nPrognosis: A wave of improvement has apparently begun in this case and there \\nmay be one or two periods of great improvement, or even perfect health \\nlasting several months each. Within two years death is almost certain to \\nfollow. Perliapts two cases in a hundred recover. \\n\\nTreatment: Fowler\\'s solution, 2 drops after meals well diluted and increased \\n1 drop daily until toxic symptoms appear, is considered the best method of \\nprolonging life; 50 to 60 drops a day may be taken for some weeks. A few \\ncases have improved after vigorous laxative treatment, t.e., enough cascara \\nto produce several movements daily for weeks at a time. Beat, fresh air, and \\nas much food as the stomach will bear are indicated. Hemorrhages are to be \\nchecked by pressure with gauie, with or without adrenalin solution. Iron, \\noxygen, and bone marrow are of no value.']\n",
      "The document 7 has the following 'case': ['CASE 9 \\n\\nJ. B., male, aged 32 (occupation, cook), came to the out- \\npatient department of the hospital Jan. 6, 1899. His family history \\nwas negative and previous history good. He denied any syphilitic \\ninfection, but admitted having had a urethritis some years previously. \\nHe had never had an attack similar in character to this. The present \\nillness he dated from December 30, 1898, eight days before applying for \\nrelief at the hospital. The first symptoms seemed to have come on \\nrather suddenly with a rigor of marked severity, followed by fever and, \\nlater, by profuse sweating. Almost immediately afterward he was \\nseized with intense muscular pains, extending over the trunk and limbs; \\nthese pains were agonizing in character, increased on the slightest exer- \\ntion, and had been present, with varying degrees of severity, until his \\nadmission. They prevented him from sleeping, and were spoken of \\nby the patient as being not unlike rheumatism, i.e., dull and aching, \\nwhile he was in the recumbent posture, becoming intensely lancinating \\nas soon as the slightest exercise was attempted. His appetite, which \\nhad previously been of the beat, was absolutely lost and he had eaten \\nnothing for three days. With the exception of some slight frequency \\nof micturition and a slight cough with expectoration, there was nothing \\nelse of importance in the history of the illness. \\n\\nExamination: The patient is rather a large, well-formed man, the \\nmucous membranes of good color, tongue moist, and with a slight white \\nfur. The eyes are markedly injected, the eyelids slightly but distinctly \\n(edematous, and an erythematous area above the swelling. Negative \\nresults were obtained everywhere on auscultation and percussion, \\nexcept at the bases of both lungs behind, where a few moist rales were \\nmade out. The heart sounds were quite clear. The liver and spleen were \\nnot palpable; the abdomen was soft and natural in appearance, nega- \\ntive results being obtained on palpation. No rose spots were seen. \\nThere was no superficial glandular enlargement. Pulse was 100, \\nrespiration 24 to the minute. The temperature ranged in the vicimty \\nof 103\" for three weeks and then gradually subsided. The urine was \\nnormal in color, acid, sp. gr. 1026. Microscopically, it showed \\npus-corpuscles in considerable quantity, epithelial cells, and a few \\nmucous cylinders. \\n\\n1, What important informatioQ might be gained hj testing; the knee-jerks in this \\n\\ncase? Neuritis — one of the diagnoaes to be considered in this case would \\nbe suggested if the knee-jerks were diminished or absent. \\n\\n2. Commonest causes (a) of absent knee-jerk? (6) of increased knee-jerk? (a) Neuritis, \\n\\ntabes, anterior poliomyelitis. (6) Brain hemorrhage or other organic brain \\nlesion (focal or diffuse), spastic paraplegia, pressure myelitis, chronic arthritis.\\n\\n3. What infectiotu diaeaaM cause severe pains in the trunk and limba? Grippe, \\n\\ntonnUttia, variola, dengue, trichiniasis, yellow (ever. Milder pains accompany \\nsome caees of typhoid, sepsis, pneumonia, or any other infection. \\n\\n4. What further examinations would throw light, upon your preliminary diagnosis \\n\\nhere? Blood examination and tests of the deep reBexes. \\n6, Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: Blood examination showed a leucocytoeis. This suggested a dif- \\nferential count which revealed a very marked eoainophilia. A bit of the \\nbiceps muscle was then excised and trichina were demonstrated in it by \\nhistological examination. If blood examination is included in our investiga- \\ntion of such a case, diagnosis (in temperate climat«8) is usually very easy as \\nthere is no other chronic febrile disease with eosinophilia and severe muscu- \\nlar ptuus. In the tropics other fevers complicated by the presence of \\nint«stinal parasites may be hard to distinguish from trichiniasis unless \\ntrichine are found in the muscles. In any climate many cases closely \\nsimulate typhoid and without blood examination are sura to be mbtaken \\nfor it. Others pass as \" muscular rheumatism.\" \\n\\nFrt^inosia: Host cases recover in the couise of a few months or less. Belapaes \\n\\nTreatment is thus far inefficient. We seek to relieve pain and support strength. ']\n",
      "The document 8 has the following 'case': ['CASE 10 \\n\\nThe patient is a contractor of 50. He ia of heavy build, stout \\nand red in the face. For several years he has had violent cough in the \\nwinter, accompanied by vomiting. A daughter of 16 some years ago \\nran off with a man and got married. He tooic to his bed, cursed, cried, \\ncalled for his pistols and was going to kill the husband, but calmed \\ndown soon and the young people were sent for. His physician thinks \\nhe does not use alcohol in notable excess. Two weeks ago he began \\nto complain of tearing and cutting pains in his legs, accompanied by \\nslight cedema, and for several day^ now he has been in his bed. Fever \\nhas been absent. There has been some vomiting, not specially char- \\nacteristic in any way. He has been much excited and has threatened \\nto kill all Democrats. Sleep has been poor. The pains in the legs \\nhave continued, but less severely since he took to bed. \\n\\nThe pulse is 80, regular, the tongue heavily coated, thorax negative. \\nThe edge of the liver can be felt two inches below the costal border, \\napparently smooth of surface. Motion and tactile sensibility in the \\nlegs seem normal, but the leg muscles are tender and the knee-jerks \\nare very slight, even on reenforcgment. The urine report is negative. \\n\\n1. Whftt important facts about his eariy history do we need to knowT Has he \\n\\nbad syphilis? How much alcohol has he taken? \\n\\n2. Why is his sleep poor? Poor Bleep in an active man should always tni&iest \\n\\nalcoholism, though there are of course numy other causes. \\n\\n3. Why is the liver smooth? All types of enlarged liver {except those due to \\n\\ncancer and Byphilis) are usually smooth as felt through the belly wall. The \\n\"hobnails\" of cirrhosis can rarely be felt, so that smoothness does not exclude \\ncirrhosis. Fatty infiltrttion seems, however, more likely. \\n\\n4. Wliat is meant by reenforcement of knee-jerks? We distract the patient\\'s \\n\\nattention and concentrate brain control on the muscles of his hands by mak- \\ning him lock his bands together and then break them apart just when \\nwe tap on the patella tendon. This tends to \"bring out\" knee-jerks. \\n\\n5. How is the ledema of the legs to be accounted for? (3ee diagnosis.) \\n\\n6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: The pains and tenderness in the legs, with diminished knee-jerks \\nand cedema, strongly suggest neuritis. The pupils must be tested. If they are \\nnormal, tabes is unhkely, especially as the pains here present are not at all \\ncharacteristic of tabes. It should be pointed out that oedema is not un- \\ncommon in neuritis, not only in the epidemic form (\"wet\" beri-beri) but in \\nordinary alcoholic cases. Other causes of (edema (cardiac, renal, hemic, \\nlocal — e.g., varicose veins) must be excluded. \\n\\nThe cause of the neuritis is probably alcoholism, despite his physician\\'s state- \\nment. This would also explain mental symptoms, vomiting, and enlarged \\nliver. Dementia paralytica is excluded by the local signs in the legs and liver. \\n\\nPrognous: If alcohol is given up recovery should follow. It proved so. \\n\\nTreatment: Stop alcohol. Relieve pain by local applications and electricity. \\nGive bromide and trional for sleep, capsicum and nux vomica for appetite. ']\n",
      "The document 1 has the following 'case': ['CASE 2\\n\\nA fireman of 26 w&s exercising engine-horses, riding one and leading \\nanother. The led horse fell and, as he struggled to rise, wrenched \\nseverely the arm of the fireman, who had not let go the halter. He \\nthought nothing of it at the time, but twenty-four hours later began \\nto be distressed by a sense of weight and pressure beneath the sternum, \\nnear the attachment of the wrenched pectoral. Under medical advice \\nhe was laid oS duty and treated with liniments and counter-irritation, \\nbut without relief. Three weeks\\' vacation in the country benefited \\nhim, but on his return to work he was unable to drive or even to \\nput on the foot brake without great exhaustion. Now he cannot \\nwalk a block fast without feeling tired out and experiencing a sense of \\npressure under the sternum. His wife tells him that he moans and \\ngrinds his teeth in his sleep. He has lost flesh, strength, and color. \\n\\nThe heart\\'s apex is in the fifth interspace and mammary line. \\nThere is reduplication of the apex second sound, and at the fifth left \\ncostal cartilage a systolic murmur, louder in the recumbent position. \\nThe pulmonic second sound is slightly louder than the aortic. \\n\\nInterrupted inspiration is detected in both fronts and both inter- \\nscapular regions, also transient rales in the sixth intercostal space in \\nthe left axilla. Abdomen n^ative. The blood and urine are normal, \\n\\n1. What \\\\b the usual Bignificance of maaning and teeth grinding during sleep? \\n\\nFunctional cerebral irritation; no organic disease. Common in rickets and \\nin neurotic children. Popular fallacy that \"worms\" are the cause. Tripes \\nof delirium and of somnambulism may be here discussed. \\n\\n2. How is the lose of flesh, strength, and color to be explained? (See below under \\n\\ndiagnosis.) Causes of emaciation and of pallor may be considered here. \\n\\n3. How are cardiac murmurs affected by change of position? All systolic mui^ \\n\\nmurs are louder in the recumbent position. Presystolic murmurs are louder \\nin the erect position, while diastolic murmurs are unaffected. \\n\\n4. IMagnoMS? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nThe Diagnosis is traumatic neurosis. Aneurism is excluded by the age, the \\nacute onset, and the lack of evidence of mediastinal pressure. Local trauma \\nis not important, for after the vacation the symptoms were general, not local. \\nChronic latent diseases \"lighted up\\'\\' by the accident (phthisis, ansmis, \\nnephritis) are excluded by the negative physical examination. Traumatic \\nneurosis is further suggested by the interval between the accident and the onset \\nof symptoms. (Cerebral hemorrhage may come on many hours after a blow, \\nbut always produces physical signs of brain injury, as paralysis or aphasia.) \\n\\nThe Prognosis is good if treatment is wise. He should be well in six months, \\nbut may have to change his occupation. \\n, The Treatment is first encouragement and reassurance. Everything should \\nbe done to attract attention from the seat of supposed injury. Local apjidi- \\ncations (here given) are the worst possible treatment. Advise work of \\nanother kind, a bitter tonic for appetite, and hydrotherapy for sleep.']\n",

Went to work again this momiag, but gave up \\nafter half an hour owing to nausea and pain in the lower abdomen, and \\nwent to bed. At eleven o'clock had a distinct chill. Was seen for the \\nfirst time at 12.45 p.m. The patient was a stout man who looked acutely \\nsick. The chest was negative. Owing to a thick fat layer, examina- \\ntion of the abdomen was not altogether satisfactory; it was some- \\nwhat distended and tympanitic and there was considerable tenderness \\nover the lower portion below the level of the iliac crests, but no \\narea of special tenderness, nor could a tumor be felt anjnvhere. The \\nleft leg was somewhat larger than the right throughout. The skin \\nbelow the knee pitted slightly on pressure. There was a little tender- \\nness over the femoral ring. The temperature was then 103, pulse 110, \\nrespirations 26. At 3 p.m. urgent summons were received to call \\nimmediately as the patient had had a convulsion, was breathing \\nrapidly and with great difficulty, and was very cyanotic. \\n\\n1. Wliat are tbe commonest causea of cyanosis? Heart disease (valvular or parietal), \\n\\nemphyeema, pneumonia, asthma, metluemoglobiiuemia (usually from acetaniltd \\nin headache powders). \\n\\n2. What important data do you miss in the account of this case? A leucocyte \\n\\ncount and urinary examination. \\n\\n3. Do you expect a 1^ to remain swollen three years aft«r an attack of phlebitis? \\n\\nYes; the leg does not often regain its normal size. \\n\\n4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: The symptoms at the first visit were very indecisive. Diarrhcea, \\nnausea, abdominal pain with fever and weakness, suggest nothing more than \\nacute gaatro-enteritis, and even the tenderness found in the lower abdomen \\nis not distinctive. Peritonitis (possibly from appendicitis) was considered. \\nBut the history of an old femoral thrombosis and the tenderness over the \\nfemoral ring lead us to think that the thrombus may have progressed up \\ninto the abdominal veins and to interpret the later puhnonary symptoms \\n(sudden onset of ds^ncea and cyanosis) as pulmonary embolism from the \\nthrombosed abdominal veins. Autopsy showed this condition, \\n\\nFrognods: Pulmonary embolism is almost invariably fatal within a few min- \\nutes or hours, but a few cases with all signs of the disease have recovered. \\n\\nTreatment; Oxygen is usually administered and may possibly be of some ser- \\nvice. Otherwise tbe treatment is purely expectant and symptomatic.\"]\n",
      "The document 9 has the following 'case': ['CASE 11 \\n\\nA female domestic, 29 years old, single, lost her father, a dissipated \\nman, from phthisis. She herself was chlorotic five years ago, but has \\nbeen otherwise well. A year ago she took a severe coid, and after a \\nfew days felt a sudden intense pain in the left lower axilla. Cough \\nfollowed, with little or no sputa. She was not long laid up, but has \\nbeen short of breath on exertion ever since. She denies persistent \\ncough, and states that it is present only when she takes cold; expec- \\ntoration at these times is scanty, but has several times been blood- \\nstreaked. She thinks she has lost no flesh and has not been feverish. \\nShe has been and is now steadily at work. Her employer sends her to \\nbe looked at while the physician is visiting a member of the family. \\n\\nThe general appearance is that of health; pulse and temperature \\nnormal. She complains only of dyspnoea on exertion, dry cough, and \\nanorexia. The chest is symmetrical; the interspaces are well defined; \\nno cardiac impulse is visible; the left chest dilates less than the right. \\nThe heart sounds are loudest, and the impulse best felt just below the \\nensiform cartilage; the sounds are normal. The cardiac dulness seems \\nto extend farther than usual to the right of the sternum. The right \\nchest is hyper-resonant throughout, with puerile respiration. The left \\nchest, including the cardiac area, is tympanitic with very feeble respi- \\nration and absence of vocal fremitus. In the left lower axilla there \\nis faint, amphoric breathing. \\n\\n1. What pulmonaiy diseases cause pain? Pleurisy (\"simple,\" tuberculous, or \\n\\npneumonic), malignant disease. \\n\\n2. Significance of bloody sputa? If blood appears in streaks it is usually from \\n\\nthe throat (pharyngitis) . In phthisis blood is usually in larger amount. \\n\\n3. What do jou infer from the fact that this patient has not felt sick enough to \\n\\ndisable her from work and has the appearance of health? The disease, what- \\never it is, must be producing chiefly, local, not constitutional effects. \\n\\n4. Under what conditions is the cardia<! impulse absent? Thick chest walls or \\n\\nemphysema may hide the heart; pleural effusion, pneumothorax or adhesions \\nmay displace it behind the atemum. Its beat may be too weak to feel. \\n\\n5. In what diseases may cardiac dulness extend more than 2 cm. beyond the \\n\\nri^t eternal margin? Whenever the ri^t heart is distended, and whenever \\nthe heart is displaced to the right from any cause. \\n\\n6. Significance of puerile respiration? Extra work done by the lung. \\n\\n7. What changes in the blood and urine do you expect in this ease? Normal \\n\\nblood, possibly a slight leucocytoais. Probably normal urine; possibly albu- \\nminuria and a few casts. \\n\\n8. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: Succussion produced a loud splash. Pneumobydrothorax was \\nobvious, probably ot tuberculous origin. The latency of symptoms is sur- \\nprising but not unprecedented. Bacilli were later found in the sputa. \\nPrognosis: That of moderately severe phthisis, not incipient and not advanced- \\nTreatment: Forced feeding, rest in the open air; later, moderate exercise.']\n",
      "The document 5 has the following 'case': ['CASE 7 \\n\\nA married woman of 50, has had three children, the youngest 17, \\nno miscarriage, and has passed the menopause without disturb- \\nance. Soon after the birth of her second child she became unconscious \\nwith dilated pupils, had convulsions, right hemiplegia and aphasia \\nbut recovered entirely. Her domestic life has not been happy for some \\nyears. During the eighteen months that she has been under the care \\nof her present attendant she has had emotional attacks, periods of \\nmental depression and insomnia, goes to bed, refuses food, and if crossed \\nbecomes hysterical. Passed last summer in the country with benefit. \\nIn the autumn she went to the office of her physician for swelling of \\nthe face and puffiness of the eyelids, and complained that the skin was \\ndry and perspiration deficient. Nine months later these symptoms \\npersist. She denies special sensitiveness to cold. Several examina- \\ntions of the urine have been made with negative results. The twenty- \\nfour-hour quantity is not known. The pulse is 72, regular; the tem- \\nperature normal; the blood negative; the tongue clear. The complexion \\nis somewhat waxy; the eyelids are rather baggy and translucent; the \\nwhole face had a puffy look. The skin ^ on a warm day, June 17 — \\nis slightly moist. Visceral examination is negative except for a mobile \\nright kidney. No motor paralysis; reflexes and sensibility normal. \\n\\n1 . What is the significance of the mobile right kidney in relation to the other symp- \\n\\ntoma of this catief It is inugnificant and the physician should on no account \\nmention its presence, which may give rise to great alarm. \\n\\n2. What was the cause of the hemiplegia and aphasia? The toxnmia known as \\n\\neclampsia seems to account for them. A small cerebral hemorrhage is \\npossible. \\n\\n3. What test would make the diagnosis easier? (See diagnosis.) \\n\\n4. Diagnosis? Progno«s7 Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis; The age and sex, the mental symptoms, the dry skin and puffy, \\nwarty face, with negative urine and heart, strongly suggest myxcedema. \\nThe therapeutic test (see question 3) confirmed this suggestion. Thyroid \\nextract produced a rapid improvement and final cessation of all the symptoms. \\nThe only atypical features of the case are the absence of subnormal tempera- \\nture and of sensitiveness to cold. The apparently eclamptic seizure in early \\nhfe is interesting in view of the possible connection between eclampsia and \\ndeficient thyroid activity which various writers have recently suggested. \\n\\nPrognosis: Under persistent thyroid treatment she should remain well for her \\nnatural term of life. \\n\\nTreatment; Any of the standard thyroid tablets may be given in doses of 2 \\ngrains thrice daily, gradually increadng until the pulse rate quickens. The \\ndrug should then be continued at whatever dose can be borne without ma- \\nterially increasing the pulse rate above normal. Considerable loss of weight \\nusually takes place in the earlier weeks of treatment.']\n",
      "The document 2 has the following 'case': ['CASE 3\\n\\nA medical s,tudent of 25 has been troubled with his joints for ten \\nyears. Attacks of pain and stiffness lay him up whenever he is sub- \\njected to any strain, mental or physical. He has had little or no fever, \\nhe thinks, in any of the attacks, but the pain and ewelling have been \\nconsiderable. He has, as a rule, one or two bad attacks each year, with \\na week or two in bed. \\n\\nThe knees, ankles, hips, hands, wrists, and elbows have been \\naffected, and in every case some stiffness and more or less swelling \\nhas remained after the pain left. Both sides are affected nearly alike. \\n\\nOf late years the attacks have grown leas severe, especially since \\nhis family has grown more prosperous and more harmonious. He is \\nnow able to attend to most of his medical work. \\n\\nExamination shows no motion in the left wrist and very little in \\neither ring finger. The range of motion in the knees and elbows is also \\nconsiderably limited. The fingers are cold, mottled, and damp. Some \\nof the finger joints and both wrists are doughy and semi-fluctuant. \\nThere is no evidence of bony enlargement anywhere. \\n\\nThe heart and internal viscera are negative, but the boy is pale \\nand rather thin. Blood and urine normal. \\n\\n1. Types and causes of arthritis? Infectious {including acute \"rheumatism\") \\n\\natrophic, hypertrophic, gouty, neurojiathic, hemophilic. \\n\\n2. What varieties of arthritis are often aasociated with cardiac diaeaaeT Only tlie \\n\\ninfectioustypes: e.g., \"rheumatic,\" septic, gonorrhceat, scarlatinal, pneumo- \\ncoccal. Tuberculous and syphilitic infections of joints are rarely associated \\nwith endocarditis. \\n\\n3. What important data are not mentioned in the above description? X-ray \\n\\nexamination, data regarding gonorrhcea and regarding muscular atrophy. \\n\\n4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nDiagnosis: X-ray examination showed marked atrophy of the articular ends \\nof the bones. There was marked muscular atrophy. No history of gonorrhoea \\nor of any other infection. The absence of any known infection, the long \\nprogressive courae in a young person, the symmetrical involvement of joints, \\nthe vaso motor signs, the absence of marked fever, and the X-ray evidence \\nall point to atrophic arthritis and serve (with the negative condition of the \\nviscera, blood, and urine) to exclude other varieties. \\n\\nPrognosis: Most cases slowly progress, but with favorable environment, hy^enic \\nand psychic, some cases are arrested, as in fact this one was, before crippling \\ndamage occurs. In such cases the injured joints never return to the normal, \\nbut the patient learns to adapt himself. Any mental or physical strain is \\nlikely to produce recrudescence, more or less serious. \\n\\nTreatment: Drugs have no effect save as they may help to improve the general \\nnutrition (bitters, iron, arsenic). Salicylates do harm. Hest in the acute \\nattacks, with warmth to the jomts, forced feeding, out-door life so far as the \\njoints permit, encouragement and freedom from worry, are important aids \\nto recovery. The excision of ankylosed joints may be necessary.']\n",
      "The document 4 has the following 'case': ['CASE 6 \\n\\nA child, 7 years of age, of healthy parentage, had made frequent \\ncomplaint of pain in the left side of abdomen and was found by her \\nmother to be rapidly losing flesh and strength. There was also an ac- \\ncount of quite frequent voiding of high-colored urine, with a brownish \\nsediment. \\n\\nAfter several weeks the emaciation progressing, the mother noticed \\nthat the left side of the abdomen was larger than the right; that there \\nwas pain and tenderness on pressure, and that periods of \" constipation \" \\noccurred, followed by the escape of large quantities of semi-liquid f«ces, \\nwithout much change in the size of abdomen or relief to the pain and \\ntenderness in left lumbar region. \\n\\nAbout this time the patient was taken to a physician, who confirmed \\nthe mother\\'s observation of loss of flesh and strength, for the child was \\npale or sallow, emaciated and extremely weak. In the left lumbar \\nregion a ma^, irregular in outline and surface, painful on palpation, \\nextended into the umbilical region and upwards to the margin of ribs \\nin front; percussion showed tympanitic resonance over the central \\nportion of the tumor. Elsewhere the tumor was flat on percussion. \\n\\nA specimen of urine showed: Reaction, acid; sp. gr. 1014; sediment, \\nbrownish and consisting of blood and brown granular matter. There \\nwere no casts, and the quantity of albumen present was small. \\n\\n1. What abdominal tumors are most frequent in children? Safcoraa of kidney; \\n\\ncongenital qrstic kidney, dilated colon, secondary enlargements of spleen and \\n\\n2. How are tumore of the kidney to be diHtinguiahed from enlargement of the \\n\\nspleen? The sharp edge of the spleen and its notch can usually be felt. The \\nkidney produces a rounded tumor palpable bimanualiy with one hand in the \\nflank. The inflated colon traverses tumors of the kidney but pssaes behind \\nthose of the spleen. \\n\\n3. DiagnoMS? Prognosis? Treatment? \\n\\nIMagnoais: The age, the .tumor, the emaciation, the luematuria without casts, \\nthe apparent anfemia, strongly suggest malignant disease of the kidney, and \\nat this age sareoma is the commonest type of malignant renal disease. Con- \\ngenital cystic disease of the kidneys does not produce such cachexia and is \\nalmost never associated with hematuria. The condition of the boweb ex- \\ncluded dilated colon. The characteristics of this tumor are not those of a \\nspleen. The tympanitic resonance over its centre is very possibly due to \\nthe colon. \\n\\nPrognosis: Recovery after operation has occurred, but b rare. Operation in \\nthis case confirmed the diagnosis, but was followed by recurrence and death \\nmx months later. \\n\\nTreatment: Surgical interference offers the only hope of recovery and should \\nbe undertaken at once. Medical treatment can only alleviate the present \\nsymptoms, — i.e., the emaciation, htematuria, and pain.']\n"
